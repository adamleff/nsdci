= Network Cache Flush (ncf)=
nsdci/dcicommon/flush.c

== Introduction ==
The Network Cache Flush api (ncf) is used to send and receive cache flush messages across a network.  It flushes size-based and time-based named caches created by the [Cache] api.  You must set up a "ncf server" to broadcast ([Broadcaster]) the flush and a "ncf client" to receive ([Receiver]) the flush. See the "Configuration" section for more information.

==TCL API ==
The api is only exposed when properly configured. See the "Configuration" section for more information.

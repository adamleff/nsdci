= Network Cache Flush (ncf)=
nsdci/dcicommon/flush.c

== Introduction ==
The Network Cache Flush api (ncf) is used to send and receive cache flush messages across a network.  It flushes size-based and time-based named caches created by the [Cache] api.  You must set up a "ncf server" to broadcast the flush and a "ncf client" to receive the flush. The api is only exposed when properly configured.  See the "Configuration" section for more information. See the "Configuration" section for more information. 

Addition Reading: [Broadcaster], [Receiver].

==TCL API ==

===ncf.addFlushCache===
Used to register named caches on the client for flush-on-connect. The entire cache will be flushed. This is useful if there are n-tier ncf repeaters in the topology. If a ncf repeater was down, it may have not forwarded ncf messages to their clients. This will ensure out of date cache entries are not used by the client after a reconnect. This is default behavior for clients connected to ncf repeaters.

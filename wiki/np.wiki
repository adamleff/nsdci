nsdci/dcicommon/poll.c

== Introduction ==
The Networked Poll api (npc, npc2, nps, nps2) is is used to maintain votes for specific positions in a bucket of 20 choices. Similar to Networked Tally api ([nt]), Networked Poll keeps a running total, but not for user-defined keys. And unlike Networked Tally, the bucket does not need to be "swept".  The api is only exposed when properly configured. See the "Configuration" section for more information.

== TCL API ==

===npc.vote===
Used to send a choice for a named poll to the poll server.  Returns a tcl list with the current standings. A choice > 20 or < 0 will return the current standing without adding a vote.  See the "Usage" section for examples.

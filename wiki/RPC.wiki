= Remote Procedure Call (rpc)=

Explain why it is needed, what it is used for (np, np2, nt, sob, etc), bennifits of HTTP? touch on old dcirpc?

Explain here that each service (np, np2, nt, sob, etc.) sets up their own rpc client - we should include those sections and params in the config section of each article.

In this bundled configuration the nssock of the tool server is also accepting rpc connections.  Should we show how to set up a separate nssock for rpc?

=Page Value (page)=
nsdci/dcicommon/page.c

==Introduction==
The Page Value api (page) is used as a "global array". It is available to all adp call frames within a connection. It can be used to create data structures at the beginning of a connection to make available later in the connection, keep state during a connection, or pass values between call frames.  It does not keep state between connections.

==TCL API==

==Usage==
The following example shows a page value being set by 2 adp call frames:

====main.adp====
{{{
    <%
        ns_adp_puts "Setting page value \"foo\" to 1..."
        page.setValue foo 1
        ns_adp_include include.inc
        ns_adp_puts "The value of \"foo\" is now: [page.getValue foo]"
    %>
}}}
====include1.inc====
{{{
    <%
        page.setValue foo 2
    %>
}}}

The output of main.adp would be:

    Setting page value "foo" to 1...
    The value of "foo" is now: 2

=Page Value (page)=
nsdci/dcicommon/page.c

==Introduction==
The Page Value api (page) is used as a "global array". It is available to all adp call frames within a connection. It can be used to create data structures at the beginning of a connection to make available later in the connection, keep state during a connection, or pass values between call frames.  It does not keep state between connections.

==TCL API==

==Usage==
The following example shows a page value being set by 2 adp call frames:

====main.adp====
{{{
    <%
        ns_adp_puts "Setting page value \"foo\" to 1..."
        page.setValue foo 1
        ns_adp_include include.inc
        ns_adp_puts "The value of \"foo\" is now: [page.getValue foo]"
    %>
}}}
====include.inc====
{{{
    <%
        page.setValue foo 2
    %>
}}}

The output of main.adp would be:

    Setting page value "foo" to 1...
    The value of "foo" is now: 2
    
==Best Practices==
The page value api should only be used in adp pages.  Writing TCL procedures that expect page values to be set is bad practice. Always explicitly pass values to procedures as arguments, use TCL upvar, or use a TCL global.

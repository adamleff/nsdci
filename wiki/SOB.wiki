= Introduction =

The Small Object Broker, or SOB, is used to send content from a tool server and/or frontend server to a middle-tier broker.  The client servers (tool and frontend) send content to, and request content from, the broker through the SOB API.  The following article will discuss configuration, the API, caching, and best practices.

= Configuration =

The bundled set up has a single AOLserver instance called "sob" brokering many different SOB servers.  You could easily break out each SOB server to its own AOLserver instance, but for simplicity we have set up a single instance, serving many SOBs. See the sobServer.tcl and sobClient.tcl for configuration information.

= Usage =

From the tool server we can "put" data on the broker. The "put" command requires a serverName, key, and value as argument. In the following example we are using a SOB server called "sob".

{{{
[neon:/usr/local/aolserver] Michael% telnet 127.0.0.1 8900
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.

Welcome to tool running at /usr/local/aolserver/bin/nsd (pid 24173)
AOLserver/4.5.0 (aolserver4_5) for osx built on Jan  4 2007 at 17:11:28
CVS Tag: $Name:  $
tool:nscp 1> nsob.put sob mySobFile "my sob data"

tool:nscp 2>
}}}

Because the tool server is also a client of the "sob" type sob server, we can request the data:

{{{
tool:nscp 2> nsob.get sob mySobFile
my sob data
tool:nscp 3> 
}}}

The Small Object Broker, or SOB, is used to send content from a tool server and/or frontend server to a middle-tier broker.  The client servers (tool and frontend) send content to, and request content from, the broker through the SOB API.  The following article will discuss configuration, the API, caching, and best practices.

The bundled set up has a single AOLserver instance called "sob" brokering many different SOB servers.  You could easily break out each SOB server to its own AOLserver instance, but for simplicity we have set up a single instance, serving many SOBs. See the sobServer.tcl and sobClient.tcl for configuration information.

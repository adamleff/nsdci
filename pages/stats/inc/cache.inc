There is one miss, or one hit and one flush, for every nfs write. There could then be another miss if the nfs server is set to send flushes via ncf. Example: A nfs write (nsob.put or ncb2.post) will look in the named cache causing causing an incr to the "hit" or "miss" stat.  If found, it will be removed causing an incr to the "flushed" stat. If the nfs server is set to send flushes, the ncf will register another miss in the stats since the client flushed on write.
